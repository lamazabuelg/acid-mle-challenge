# Machine Learning Challenge of ACID Labs

This is a submition for the Machine Learning Engineer Challenge purposed by ACID Labs on march, 2023.

## Virtual Environment
I suggest to use a **virtual environment**. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install **virtualenv**:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Once **virtualenv** library is installed, execute:

```bash
python3.9 -m virtualenv venv
```

Activate your **virtual environment** before continue:

```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

## Requirements

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install python requirements for the project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
